    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to the whimsical world of <strong>"Minister of Truth: Propagandist Simulator"</strong>, a game created during the
        <strong>Global Game Jam 2025</strong> at the Mauritius Institut Français de Maurice.
    </p>

    <p>
        Inspired by the Global Game Jam 2025 theme of <strong>"Bubbles"</strong>, our game explores the concept of
        social and informational bubbles in a satirical high-magic fantasy realm. As the Emperor's propaganda officer, your
        mission is to craft narratives that resonate within the distinct bubbles of the Empire’s factions: the intellectual Elves,
        the stubborn Dwarves, the opportunistic Humans, and the battle-hardened Orcs.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
        The game challenges players to think critically about how information is spun, how messages are tailored for different
        audiences, and how loyalties are influenced by what people—or factions—choose to believe. By navigating the delicate
        loyalties of the Empire’s citizens, you’ll experience firsthand the power and pitfalls of propaganda in shaping public
        opinion within their isolated bubbles.

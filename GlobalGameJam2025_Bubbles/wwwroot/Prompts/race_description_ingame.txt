1. Humans: Masters of Convenient Morality
Overview:
Ah, humans—the jack-of-all-trades, masters of none, and firm believers that they could master it all if only other races would stop having unfair advantages. They thrive on ambition, love a good rags-to-riches story, and believe freedom is sacred—until it inconveniences them. If there's a shortcut, they’ll take it, provided it looks respectable enough from the outside. They adore a leader who "gets things done," preferably without making them think too hard about how it’s done.

Key Messaging Strategies:

Use words like "progress," "opportunity," and "for the greater good"—vague, uplifting, and wonderfully open to interpretation.
Keep scandals buried under a healthy layer of plausible deniability. If caught, a heartfelt apology followed by immediate economic growth will do the trick.
Emphasize their special role in history—humans love believing they were chosen for greatness, despite all evidence to the contrary.
When in doubt, promise tax cuts and better trade deals. They’ll complain, but they’ll take it.
Avoid:

Mentioning other races’ natural advantages—nothing grates on a human's nerves like an elf's effortless elegance or a dwarf’s superior craftsmanship.
Stupid mistakes; humans expect cunning. If a policy flops, make it sound intentional.
Propaganda Slogan:
"A Stronger Empire, A Brighter Future, and Definitely More Opportunities for You!"

2. Orcs: Brute Force Meets Minimal Brainpower
Overview:
Orcs respect strength, plain and simple. Subtlety is wasted on them—if it’s not breaking, bleeding, or burning, they’re not interested. Their cultural idea of diplomacy involves who can shout louder, and their approach to problem-solving usually starts and ends with a fist. However, they have a surprising soft spot for loyalty, feasting, and bawdy humor, so long as you don’t make it too complicated.

Key Messaging Strategies:

Frame every policy as a "bold challenge" or "battle for greatness." They don’t really care about the details as long as it sounds like they’ll win.
Appeal to their primal instincts: "The Emperor’s decree makes us stronger!" usually works, even if it’s about tax hikes.
Reward them with glory, titles, and the occasional well-placed insult to keep them interested.
If diplomacy must happen, paint it as a "strategic conquest." They don’t need to know it involves paperwork.
Avoid:

Anything that implies they need help. Orcs do NOT need help, thank you very much.
Rules and regulations. Suggestions? Maybe. Orders? Not without a fight.
Propaganda Slogan:
"For Strength, For Honor, For Victory (And Free Ale After)!"

3. Elves: Smug Superiority Disguised as Benevolence
Overview:
Elves are, without a doubt, the most refined, intellectual, and enlightened beings in existence—or at least, that’s what they’ll tell you within the first five minutes of meeting them. They value diplomacy, art, and ecology, but only when it benefits their interests. Subtlety is their weapon of choice, and nothing thrills an elf more than a carefully crafted intrigue with at least five layers of poetic irony.

Key Messaging Strategies:

Speak in long, elegant sentences filled with wisdom, as they believe brevity is for lesser beings.
Frame policies as “preserving ancient legacies” and “ensuring harmonious balance.”
Promise ecological and cultural superiority without the messy realities of progress.
If a policy is unpopular, remind them that lesser races are watching and waiting for them to fail. Works like a charm.
Avoid:

Anything that implies short-term solutions; elves plan centuries ahead, and they expect the Empire to do the same.
Too much militarism—it’s terribly uncouth, though they do enjoy the idea of a "noble conflict."
Propaganda Slogan:
"For Culture, For Harmony, For the Eternal Glory of Our Legacy!"

4. Dwarves: Practical, Profitable, and Proudly Stubborn
Overview:
Dwarves value stability, tradition, and, above all, profit. If it doesn’t add value to their coffers or their craftsmanship, they’re not interested. They have little patience for nonsense, even less for politics, and a deep, abiding suspicion of elves and their "fancy nonsense." However, if you can convince them something increases their wealth or protects their way of life, they’ll support it begrudgingly.

Key Messaging Strategies:

Lead with economic benefits—talk about growth, mining opportunities, and “efficient resource management.”
Play on their pride in craftsmanship; suggest new imperial projects need “the finest dwarven skills.”
Frame stability and tradition as virtues the Empire must uphold; dwarves love the idea that their way is the right way.
If a policy is unfavorable, bribe them with tax breaks. They won’t like it, but they’ll take it.
Avoid:

Social changes. Dwarves have done things the same way for generations and see no reason to change now.
Anything that smells like frivolous art or "culture"—if it can’t be built or sold, it’s useless.
Propaganda Slogan:
"For Stability, For Craftsmanship, For a Prosperous Future!"

Final Recommendations for the News Office:

Humans – Sell progress and opportunity, but keep it vague and inspiring.
Orcs – Keep it short, loud, and aggressive. Bonus points for a good fight metaphor.
Elves – Wrap everything in elegance and intellectual superiority; mention trees often.
Dwarves – Talk money, tradition, and efficiency; leave poetry to the elves.
